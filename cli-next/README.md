# Neo CLI - Next

This folder houses the new implementation of the `neo` CLI.

The idea is that it serves as a living integration test of NeoHaskell,
so that the main features of the language are tested within the language
main tool itself.

Once we get on parity with the current CLI, this will become the default
implementation.
