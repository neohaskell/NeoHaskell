# Welcome

This is where the NeoHaskell code will live, once the implementation begins.

If you're confused, this is because the project prioritizes the design and documentation first, and only implementation afterwards!

Take a look at the [GitHub Milestones page](https://github.com/neohaskell/NeoHaskell/milestones) for a rough plan for the implementation.

Design documents are being worked on currently for sharing progress in a stable way with the community. Sorry for the inconvenience! üôè

# Welcome to the contributor guide

If you want to learn about NeoHaskell itself, checkout
[the NeoHaskell website](https://neohaskell.org).

This guide is intended to streamline the process of
contributing to the NeoHaskell tooling.

The repository will be a mono-repo that contains all the
different parts of NeoHaskell.

# Installing the required tools

- Install GHCUP by following [the official instructions](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).
- Run `ghcup tui` and press `s` on the following options:
  - GHC 9.2.8
  - Cabal 3.10.1.0
  - HLS 2.2.0.0
  - (When prompted for download, press `y` to accept)

The recommended IDE for any NeoHaskell project is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# Get the code

- Fork this repository
- `git clone <url to your fork>`
- `cd neohaskell && code .`

# Install the recommended extensions

When opening the project for the first time, you will be prompted to install the recommended extensions, install them.

# Collaborate on Discord

It's always better to hack with people, so why not join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/wDj3UYzec8)?
