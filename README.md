# Welcome to the contributor guide

If you want to learn about NeoHaskell itself, checkout
[the NeoHaskell website](https://neohaskell.org).

This guide is intended for streamlining the process of
contributing to the NeoHaskell tooling.

The repository will be a mono-repo that contains all the
different parts of NeoHaskell.

# Installing the required tools

- Install GHCUP by following [the official instructions](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).
- Run `ghcup tui` and press `s` on the following options:
  - GHC 9.2.8
  - Cabal 3.10.1.0
  - HLS 2.2.0.0
  - (When prompted for download, press `y` to accept)

The recommended IDE for any NeoHaskell project is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# Get the code

- Fork this repository
- `git clone <url to your fork>`
- `cd neohaskell && code .`

# Install the recommended extensions

When opening the project for the first time, you will be prompted to install the recommended extensions, install them.

# Collaborate on Discord

It's always better to hack with people, so why not joining the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/wDj3UYzec8)?
