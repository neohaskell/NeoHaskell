{-
Actions (Action) are essentially a callback that is called after some side effect
happens. First, the platform, or the user, will register action handlers that will
act as effectful functions that will be triggered when the action is submitted
into the Action queue (this is hidden from the user, and handled by the platform),
then, when the user returns a action of this kind either in the init function or
the update function, the platform will submit the action to the queue, and the
handler will be called with the action as an argument. Usually the action constructors
are basically functions that configure everything to be ready to be executed.

For example, one might want to read a file right when the app starts, so one would do
this in the init function by using a hypothetical FileSystem.readFile action, configured
with the path to the file. If the user desires to handle the file contents in a certain
event, they would have to use Action.map to transform the file contents into a different
action that will be called when the event happens.

Example:

type Model = [
    "someText" := Text
    ]

data Event
    = AppStarted String

init :: (Model, Action Event)
init = (
    emptyModel,
    FileSystem.readFile "someFile.txt"
      |> Action.map AppStarted
    )

The advantage of defining side effects through the usage of actions is that it
allows the side effects to be tracked in a queue, which can be inspected in many different
ways, and also test them in a controlled environment.

This allows for even more interesting features, like allowing to replay the actions without
actually executing them, or even to serialize them and send them to another platform to be
executed there. This is the basis for the time-travel debugging feature that Elm has, and
a great inspiration for the NeoHaskell platform.
