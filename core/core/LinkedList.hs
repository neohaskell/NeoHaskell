-- | In Haskell a list type is defined using square brackets. This alias allows
-- us to alternatively write the type like we would in Elm.
type LinkedList a = [a]


-- CREATE

-- | Create a list with only one element:
--
-- > singleton 1234 == [1234]
-- > singleton "hi" == ["hi"]
singleton :: a -> LinkedList a
singleton value = [value]


-- | Create a list with *n* copies of a value:
--
-- > repeat 3 (0,0) == [(0,0),(0,0),(0,0)]
repeat :: Int -> a -> LinkedList a
repeat =
  Prelude.fromIntegral .> Data.List.replicate


-- | Create a list of numbers, every element increasing by one.
--
-- You give the lowest and highest number that should be in the list.
--
-- > range 3 6 == [3, 4, 5, 6]
-- > range 3 3 == [3]
-- > range 6 3 == []
range :: Int -> Int -> LinkedList Int
range lo hi =
  [lo .. hi]


-- TRANSFORM

-- | Apply a function to every element of a list.
--
-- > map sqrt [1,4,9] == [1,2,3]
-- > map not [True,False,True] == [False,True,False]
--
-- So @map func [ a, b, c ]@ is the same as @[ func a, func b, func c ]@
map :: (a -> b) -> LinkedList a -> LinkedList b
map =
  Mappable.map


-- | Same as @map@ but the function is also applied to the index of each element
-- (starting at zero).
--
-- > indexedMap Tuple.pair ["Tom","Sue","Bob"] == [ (0,"Tom"), (1,"Sue"), (2,"Bob") ]
indexedMap :: (Int -> a -> b) -> LinkedList a -> LinkedList b
indexedMap f xs =

-- | Reduce a list from the left.
--
-- > foldl (+)  0  [1,2,3] == 6
-- > foldl (::) [] [1,2,3] == [3,2,1]
--
-- So @foldl step state [1,2,3]@ is like saying:
--
-- > state
-- >   |> step 1
-- >   |> step 2
-- >   |> step 3
--
-- Note: This function is implemented using fold' to eagerly evaluate the
-- accumulator, preventing space leaks.

--
-- > foldr (+)  0  [1,2,3] == 6
-- > foldr (::) [] [1,2,3] == [1,2,3]

--
-- > state
-- >   |> step 3
-- >   |> step 2
-- >   |> step 1

-- | Filter out certain values. For example, maybe you have a bunch of strings
-- from an untrusted source and you want to turn them into numbers:
