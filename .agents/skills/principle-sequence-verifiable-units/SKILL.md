# Sequence work into verifiable units

Order work as a sequence of small, coherent units. A unit may span the Haskell types, instances, generators, and consumers needed for one contract change, rather than one file or edit. Normally, don't advance until the current unit's relevant checks pass.

**Why:** A break caught at the unit that caused it is cheap to localize. A break caught after a batch is buried, and you have already built further on a broken base. Sequencing those same units into a delivery a reviewer can replay turns "trust me" into "watch it go red, then green."

**Execution.** In a sweep, migration, or any run of similar edits, verify each coherent unit before starting the next. Each unit is a before/after bracket: known-good state, one change, run the check, then proceed. Rebase onto clean trunk first so every check measures against the real baseline. When a lever does the edits, the per-unit check is nearly free. Run it anyway. For planned migrations with temporary breakage, follow the declared phase boundaries and targeted checks in [Outcome-Oriented Execution](../principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md), rather than requiring every intermediate edit to compile.

**Delivery.** Stack commits and PRs in the order that proves the work. The canonical shape is the failing test first, then the fix on top. Other story orders are a subtraction before the reshape, a baseline capture before the treatment, the scaffold before the feature. Each commit lands on its own and the sequence reads as an argument.

The sequencing complement to the **prove-it-works** principle skill, which keeps each check real, and the **build-the-lever** principle skill, which makes the per-unit check cheap.
