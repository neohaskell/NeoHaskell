# Architect

Sketch Haskell types, function signatures, service records, relevant typeclass or instance shapes, and module boundaries for NeoHaskell framework, language, and toolchain internals. State the semantic contract alongside the types, including evaluation or representation behavior when relevant. Mark incomplete bodies and logic explicitly in the sketch. Compare independent candidate perspectives, then fill in code against the chosen sketch within the caller's requested scope.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before starting.

1. Ground
2. Sketch
3. Agree
4. Implement
5. Scrap

## Phase A: Ground the problem

Build a real mental model of every system the new code touches. Run the **how** skill over the relevant subsystems. Naming a file isn't grounding. Produce the architectural explanation `how` prescribes. If the design redefines ownership or layering, also run the **why** skill on the existing shape so the rationale becomes a constraint, not a guess.

Use [How](../how/SKILL.md)'s local codemap to locate relevant modules, signatures and service fields before reading their source. Its source index refreshes on lookup. Confirm evidence and coverage against the maintained implementation before making an architectural claim.

Skip Phase A only when the work is genuinely greenfield with no surrounding system to integrate.

## Phase B: Sketch

Run the **arena** skill with the design-sketch task and the Phase A grounding artifacts. Pass `references/runner-prompt.md` as each runner's prompt.

Use the current environment's configured architecture runner roles through **arena** and its available delegation interface. Inherit supported runtime defaults when no role override is configured; report unsupported overrides rather than inventing fallback identifiers. Use only supported reasoning and speed settings. Centralized role configuration is managed separately; keep candidate investigations independent within the available delegation capacity.

Design it twice. Require at least two structurally distinct candidates before synthesis, even when the first looks sufficient. This is the **exhaust-the-design-space** principle skill made concrete. Whole-shape alternatives, not point fixes inside one shape.

Screen every candidate against [`references/design-red-flags.md`](references/design-red-flags.md) before synthesis. Apply [Security by Construction](../principle-security-by-construction/SKILL.md) and [Design for Throughput](../principle-design-for-throughput/SKILL.md) to each candidate: identify relevant trust/authority boundaries, safe defaults and whole-flow costs. Carry assumptions, tradeoffs and required evidence into the rationale; keep the treatment proportionate to the affected path. Assume the next contributor is an agent that sees only the files it opened, copies the nearest example, and takes the shortest path that compiles. Prefer the design where a change that looks right from one file is right for the whole repo.

Compare viable candidates on interface depth. Prefer the design that hides more complexity behind a smaller, simpler public surface. A rich interface can keep call chains short by concentrating capability instead of scattering it across layers.

Arena returns one synthesized design package. Its synthesis decision fills the rationale's "Synthesis decision" section.

## Phase C: Agree (opt-in)

Default for an implementation request: proceed directly to implementation with the synthesized design. No human checkpoint. For a request limited to design or a sketch, deliver the design package and stop at that requested scope.

Opt in to a checkpoint when the invoker explicitly asks: "/architect with checkpoint," "stop and show me before implementing," or similar. Then surface the synthesized design and pause for sign-off.

The synthesis can ship as its own commit either way, as the "scaffold first" mode of the **foundational-thinking** principle skill. Planned and scoped breakage during fill-in is fine, per the **outcome-oriented-execution** principle skill. For adversarial pressure on the design before implementing, run the **interrogate** skill on the synthesized sketch.

If the human pushes back on the shape (in a checkpoint or after the fact), treat that as Phase A evidence. Re-ground and re-run Phase B before writing more code.

## Phase D: Implement against the sketch

Replace explicitly incomplete sketch bodies and pseudocode with Haskell implementations. Keep incomplete definitions confined to sketch artifacts or the declared scaffold phase; typechecking an incomplete definition does not prove its behavior. The synthesized sketch is the contract. Deviations from it are signal to surface, not friction to absorb silently. If a function needs a parameter the sketch didn't anticipate, ask whether the sketch was wrong, the requirement was missed, or the implementation is overreaching.

## Phase E: Scrap when the architecture is wrong

If implementation keeps producing friction the sketch can't absorb, throw the sketch out. Don't bolt fixes onto a wrong design, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** and **fix-root-causes** principle skills.

The signal is a *pattern*, not single instances. Tells:

- The same shape of workaround appearing repeatedly across unrelated code.
- Multiple unrelated edge cases that all need special-case branches.
- Types that need escape hatches such as `unsafeCoerce`, partial functions, or `Maybe` fields that callers must always unwrap to satisfy an unstated invariant.
- Synchronization appearing across callers because the sketch missed the subsystem that owns the shared-state invariant or worker lifetime.
- Callers having to know the abstraction's internal rules to use it.
- Two or more independent Phase D deviations of the same shape across the implementation.

Use judgment. A few edge cases don't condemn an architecture. Some problems are legitimately complex. Complexity in the data is not complexity in the design.

When you scrap:

1. Re-run the **how** skill over what's been built.
2. Redesign as if the new constraints had been day-one assumptions, per redesign-from-first-principles.
3. Subtract before adding, per the **subtract-before-you-add** principle skill. The new sketch should be smaller than the old one before it grows.
4. Return to Phase B and re-run arena.

## Outputs

The caller's usage is written first and the type sketch derived from it. One file with new types and signatures for small changes. Module map plus type definitions for larger work. The rationale ships alongside, shaped per `references/rationale-template.md`, including the usage sketch and the synthesis decision.
